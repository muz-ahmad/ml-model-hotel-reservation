# Objective
- Build Machine Learning models using hotel reservation dataset and demonstrate the use case on hotel booking demand analysis & cancelation prediction.
- To demonstrate the usage of AutoML library to develop the "first-glimpse" model using PyCaret.

# Dataset
- This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
- `Data source`: The original data source can be downloaded from [ Antonio et al. (2019): Hotel booking demand datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191)
- `Raw Dataset`: hotel_bookings.csv
- `Processed Dataset`: hotel_bookings_v1
  
# Tools
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `PyCaret`: Python package for AutoML, install using `pip install`. Read about PyCaret [here](https://pycaret.org/)
- ML model: K-means clustering, LightGBM classifier, Random Forest regressor
